Bugs and feature request are tracked on GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/jaymoulin/docker-twitter-cli)

Configuration
-------------

First, you need to authenticate to twitter with the following command:
Please note that this package is also hosted on Github Container Registry, just add `ghcr.io/` before the image name (`docker pull ghcr.io/jaymoulin/twitter-cli` instead of `jaymoulin/twitter-cli`)

```
docker run -ti --rm -v /path/to/authkey/folder:/root jaymoulin/twitter-cli authorize
```

Then, follow the displayed instructions.

When done, you should be able to execute [Sferik's T (Twitter CLI client)](https://github.com/sferik/t) commands following this pattern:


```
docker run -ti --rm -v /path/to/authkey/folder:/root jaymoulin/twitter-cli <command>

```

For example:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v ~/.trc:/root/.trc jaymoulin/twitter-cli whois moulinjay
```

Should give you something like :
